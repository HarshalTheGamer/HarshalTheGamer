Hey! I am Harshal Patil Currently working on a Password Manager 
for that I have used Python as it is a terminal friendly language(The Project is required to on terminal)
Cryptography is the library that is main focus of this project   
To run this simply download the manager.py file, run it in terminal having same path  
Make sure tha you have python 3.10 or greatere version(It include swithc case which works on latest version)  
After running it will give you some prompts, to which you can choose what you want to do  
Initially it requires to load the key and the password files, that has to be done by the user
